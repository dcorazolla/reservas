# SonarQube (removed from repo)

This repository previously included optional local SonarQube instructions and scripts. Per current project policy, SonarQube integration is no longer started by default and related instructions were removed from main documentation.

If you need to run SonarQube for local analysis, refer to SonarQube official docs: https://docs.sonarqube.org/ and reintroduce any integration scripts as a separate, opt-in utility outside of the main development flow.
