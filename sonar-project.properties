## SonarQube scanner configuration (DEPRECATED)

# This file was used previously to configure local SonarQube analysis.
# SonarQube integration is no longer part of the default development flow
# and has been removed from the main documentation and Docker Compose.
# If you need to re-enable local Sonar analysis, restore or recreate this
# file with appropriate values and reintroduce the optional scripts.

# NOTE: kept here only as an archival reference and will be removed in a
# future cleanup. Prefer SonarCloud or an external analysis pipeline.
